KARAMOJA FOOD INSECURITY:
Creating an interactive data visualization monitoring tool to support the decision-making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

Assessment
Tableau Workbook:

##Overview

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks.

In Karamoja, several NGOs provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yields. Though, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision-making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

##Quiding Principle
As a Data Scientist, the agri-tech team is asking you to develop an interactive visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. This visualization tool that you will develop will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.

##Required
Based on your experience, the team expects you to come up with a first draft within the coming 3 working days. They give you carte blanche in terms of structure and functionalities but they know that the client wants:
a) Create at least a map in the dashboard.
b) Have a visualization of the results by district or sub-county.
c) Using crosstabs, geographical maps, heat maps, and/or combo charts. 
d) Use trend lines, reference lines, and statistical techniques to describe data.
e) Use group, bin, hierarchy, sort, set, and filter options effectively. Perform basic calculations, including string manipulation, basic arithmetic calculations, custom aggregations and ratios, totals, date math, logic statements, and quick table calculations.
f) Make changes to options in formatting visualizations.
g) Combine multiple visualizations into a dashboard.
